# Full Stack JavaScript Project 1

For this project, we had to find several quotes, list them in an object array, display them on the page and get the change quote button functional.

## The Brief
For this first project, you'll create an app that displays random famous quotes each time a button is clicked. You will select your own quotes from famous historical figures, artists, scientists, celebrities, etc.

You'll locate and select your own quotes. Please select tasteful, positive and uncontroversial quotes, for the sake of this project. Thank you.

You'll use your growing knowledge of basic JavaScript syntax, variables, loops, conditionals and object literals to:

-   Build the array of quote objects to store the quotes.
-   Write your own functions for selecting random quotes from the array and printing them to the screen.

## Outcome
I selected several quotes for use in this project. The quotes change every 15 seconds automatically and the background colour changes to a completely random one for every quote that appears. You also have the choice to click the button to change the quote.
